Shawky’s play with the past is rooted in fantasy, fiction, and wonder, as he stages performances and films that subtly excavate the bases of the stories that countries and continents tell themselves to form an identity, a belief system, and then a history.

The films recount the story of the Crusades, a series of military expeditions between 1095 and 1291 led by the Catholic Church into the Holy Land to wrest Jerusalem from Islamic rule. Reframing the Crusades through an Arab lens, Shawky sheds light on the problematic nature of Euro-centric historiography that privileges one version of the past over another.

The tapestries, however, include only four women. The fifth is understood to be the artist, whose women’s work is unpictured but present in the objects’ material being. Later works feature looser threads, chaotic lines, and painted marks to create visual landscapes evoking the complexity of womanhood.

Art historian Chika Okeke-Agulu has argued that her focus on the undressed female body, autoeroticism, and homosexuality derives from and is a response to these early experiences in Egypt.
