Among his most famous works is the film Johannesburg - Second Greatest City after Paris, created by continuously modifying, erasing, and layering a series of charcoal drawings. This drawing from the film addresses the “procession of the dispossessed,” a theme that has recurred in Kentridge’s work for several decades.The film, made in 1989 while apartheid was still underway, follows two central characters named Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitelbaum, in the process exploring South African history. Viewers watch Soho amass wealth and power by exploiting Black workers; his counterpart, Felilx, is an artist, forming the alter ego to Soho with a greater emphasis on his anxiety and vulnerability.

Signed by Steve Mulimer, the drawing depicts a Black boy of 12 years with red eyes and red streaked on the side of his face and neck. The smudging of charcoal alternately highlights and shades the contours of the boy’s face. His flat expression and exaggerated features, however, reveal a vision of Africans that aligns more with Lydia’s characterization as primitive, dark, and foreign. That Lydia made this the first page of her scrapbook sets the tone for the remainder, in which Black Africans are largely treated as objects of ethnographic curiosity. Lydia repeatedly emphasizes the distance in culture between herself and the various groups she visits. In this, she exemplifies an attitude of the white gaze that Kentridge seeks to unveil and undermine.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.strong, {\n        children: \"For further reading:\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"Fleming, David H. “Charcoal Matter with Memory: Images of Movement, Time and Duration in the Animated Films of William Kentridge.” \", _jsx(\"i\", {\n        children: \"Film-Philosophy\"\n      }), \" 16, no. 2 (2012): 402-423.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"Kentridge, William and Ed Schad, eds. \", _jsx(\"i\", {\n        children: \"William Kentridge: In Praise of Shadows.\"\n      }), \" Exhibition catalogue.

Characterized by repeating geometric shapes, bold lines, and bright colors of red, green, blue, yellow, and pink interspersed with black and white, the homes themselves become works of art. The chevron and diamond patterns, the competing graphic elements, had the color choice all spoke to certain rites of passage. Mahlangu speaks to the significance of this work within the community: “When you get married, you paint your first house.

To this end, Mahlangu founded an art school that educates youths in the artistic traditions of the Ndebele.
