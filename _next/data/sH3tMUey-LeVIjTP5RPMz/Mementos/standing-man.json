Ivory had long been coveted by those outside Africa and Asia for its unique material qualities and beauty. Lydia’s proclivity for warrior statuettes aligns with her collection of various weapons like bows, arrows, knives. Her focus on weaponry in many forms speaks to a long-lasting stereotype of African cultures as primitive hunter-gatherers.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"Dimensions\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"15.5 cm (height)\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"IIIF Manifest\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/c8eec63b-7bb5-4d24-bc2d-251e2452bd11?as=iiif\",\n        children: \"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/c8eec63b-7bb5-4d24-bc2d-251e2452bd11?as=iiif\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"For further reading\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"Couttenier, Maarten. “The Museum as Rift Zone – The Construction and Representation of ‘East’ and 'Central' Africa in the (Belgian) Congo Museum/Royal Museum for Central Africa.” \", _jsx(\"i\", {\n        children: \"History in Africa\"\n      }), \" 46 (2019): 327-358.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"Hill, Shannen. \", _jsx(\"i\", {\n        children: \"The Art of African Ivory\"\n      }), \".
