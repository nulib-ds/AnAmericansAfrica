Calabash in Hausa language, spoken in parts of northern Nigeria, is called “kwarya”.

A prominent carver among them was named Onírèsé, who was identified by an Ifa priest at birth as a great leader.

A classic example is the Tray with the design of snake. Snakes are revered in many parts of Africa; the python, for example,depicts the war god Ogidia among the people of Benin and Brass of the Niger Delta region. Similarly, snakes are significant in Yoruba tradition, symbolizing rebirth and renewal. This symbolism is deeply rooted in Yoruba mythology, where the snake is associated with Osumare, a rainbow serpent god. The god is the son of the goddess Yemọja and the God Ọ̀rúnmìlà. Because snakes shed their skin, the god is associated with rebirth or renewal. This belief is carried by practitioners of Yoruba religion in Nigeria, Benin, Brazil, and Cuba, making the Tray with the design of snake a powerful transatlantic cultural object.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"Dimensions\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"48 cm (diameter)\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"IIIF Manifest\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/d4e3d25a-acc4-498c-8a26-c07f3c2ee46a?as=iiif\",\n        children: \"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/d4e3d25a-acc4-498c-8a26-c07f3c2ee46a?as=iiif\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"For further reading\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://derekdodds.com/yoruba-mythology-gods-who-were-yamanja-and-oxumare/\",\n        children: \"Derek Dodds. “Yoruba Mythology Gods: Who Were Yemanja and Oxumare?,” March 18, 2023.\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsxs(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/calabashes-in-northern-nigeria/\",\n        children: [\"Kona, Mildred A. “Calabashes in Northern Nigeria.” \", _jsx(\"i\", {\n          children: \"Expedition Magazine\"\n        }), \" 17, no. 1 (1974): 2-10.\"]\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"Hambly, Wilfred D. “The Serpent in African Belief and Custom.”\", _jsx(\"i\", {\n        children: \"American Anthropologist,\"\n      }), \" 3, no. 4 (1929): 655-666.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"Johnson, Samuel. \", _jsx(\"i\", {\n        children: \"The History of the Yorubas: From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the British Protectorate.\"\n      }), \" Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1921.\"]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)\n  })) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\nfunction _missingMdxReference(id, component) {\n  throw new Error(\"Expected \" + (component ? \"component\" : \"object\") + \" `\" + id + \"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.\");\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{"title":"Tray with design of snake","navigation":"Mementos"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
