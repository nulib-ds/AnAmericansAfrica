But Lydia Luhman Pederson was actually the latest in a long line of female travelers to Egypt that extended back to the late eighteenth century. Like the female travelers before her, Pederson was quite daring to undertake this journey, had the material resources to do so, and considered ancient Egypt central to her travel in the country. This period had fascinated Western travelers since Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1798 sparked “Egyptomania”—an Orientalist craze for designs and images from ancient Egypt that created notions of an exotic place from the past, untouched by Western colonialism exactly as colonialism was spreading, and in many ways fueling this growing tourism.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"While in Cairo, Pederson purchased three appliqués; the one included in this exhibition depicts the Pyramids, the Sphinx, an obelisk, a palm tree, two camels, and two Egyptian men of non-elite background. The craft of appliqué has been practiced in Egypt since at least the medieval period, and has a dedicated market of artisans in one of the oldest parts of the city, known as “Suq al-Khayyamiyya” or “The Tentmakers Market.” This type of appliqué that depicts Pharaonic scenes was developed mainly for the emerging tourist market, while the more longstanding craft designs tended to be large and intricate geometric patterns often drawing on Islamic decorative designs. These were often done on a large scale to serve as panels for tents that, even today, are often erected for such social events as weddings, funerals, and saints-day festivals.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"For at least 150 years before Pederson arrived, the Giza Pyramids and the Sphinx were icons of the tourist imaginary of Egypt, and as such, central to many tourist sketches and photography, as well as European Orientalist etchings, drawings, and paintings. The other elements in the appliqué have also been popular in tourist objects and Orientalist art t: palm trees, camels, and men in loose robes (known as galabiyyas) and turbans favored by peasants and sometimes those in the “popular” (or sha`bi) classes. And if there was any confusion as to whether or not the men in the appliqué were viewed as modern and contemporary to 1953, that was settled by the fact that they were given Pharaonic style beards, which men of the era did not have. Thus this appliqué, while produced by contemporary craftsmen in a burgeoning industry, clearly locates Egypt and Egyptians in the past.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The rest of the collection suggests that Pederson favored this framing. Many of Pederson’s photographs from her trip were also in the vein of European or American photography done in Egypt since cameras were first brought there. These include images of the Pyramids and of historic Islamic and Christian architecture, often taken from above—an angle scholars have described as common to colonial perspectives that seek to dominate. Her writing about the trip to the Pyramids emphasized an unbroken past, stating that the Sphinx “has looked exactly like this for six thousand years.”\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"This particular vision of Egypt tends to erase the modernity of the Cairo of 1953. At that time, Cairo was a bustling, cosmopolitan, Middle Eastern city. Just a year before, in 1952, Egyptians had taken to the streets in elation as the Free Officers, led by the globally revered independence hero of the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser, deposed the king and put the nail in the coffin of British rule. By that time, there was a robust middle class in Cairo, who dressed in Western style clothes and worked in the government or in business. Even ten years before Pederson’s visit, major textile factories had opened in the village right next to the Pyramids known as Kerdessa. It is possible that Pederson bought the textile in the environs of the Pyramids, instead of in the Tentmakers market, and that it was produced by villagers who may have also worked in the new factories.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Yet no collection, no archive, can completely hide the traces of other stories.

In some of the photos of historic architectural sites, the concrete block buildings of the growing city are visible in the distance.
