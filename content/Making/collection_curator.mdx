<h4>Reflections on creating the digital exhibit</h4>

<h4>By Esmeralda Kale, George and Mary LeCron Foster Curator of the <a href="https://www.library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/herskovits-library/collection/archival.html"> Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies </a></h4>

An email message about a trip from Cape to Cairo in 1953, quickly followed up by a phone call was my initial introduction to the Lydia Luhman Pederson Collection. There was mention of eight large reels of film documenting rituals and traditions and travel from Cape Town to Cairo with an invitation to visit Rockford, Illinois to look at the collection. Conversation continued as Sonjia Olstad told me about her Aunt Lydia.
 
On arrival at this picturesque farm, previously owned by Lydia, Sonjia and her husband, Jim, were keen to share the scrapbook they had forgotten to mention in earlier conversations. Bound in real zebra skin, its first page was an original hand drawn portrait of an African man with a feather in his hair. Further pages revealed typical postcards of the period, scenic photographs and letters from her niece. What immediately stood out was the center of the scrapbook. Chocked full of itineraries, menus, receipts and letters on introduction, it became clear that this could be a window, a personal account of private travel in Africa in the 1950s.
 
A walk through the bedrooms upstairs revealed a bow and arrows attached to the wall, Dutch/ African wax print fabric and quilted panels of the pyramids, camels and pharaohs of Egypt. Within the barn were boxes of items carved in wood and ivory, beaded necklaces and sashes. Many of these items had price tags on them. In addition, there were items made in leopard skin; handbags, a collar, muff and hats. As we moved from one location on the next farm to the next, more materials from this trip were uncovered. We finally ended up in the sunroom where the reel-to-reel film were soon packed into the car with all the other items. It had become apparent that this collection was a rich source for research.
 
Sonjia and Jim Olstad were inspired by Lydia’s travels, and when an opportunity presented itself early in their marriage to go to Nigeria and work with agricultural cattle farms they couldn’t resist. Their three-year stay in Nigeria was cut short due to the outbreak of the Biafran war in 1967. The three calabashes in this collection are just a few items from their time in Nigeria that are also included in this collection.
