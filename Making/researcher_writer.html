In this famous work, the Martinician author recounts a moment in which a white child on a street spots him, points at him, declares to her mother, “Look!

She was enamored by the idea of Africa’s mystery. She seemingly blinded herself willingly to what didn’t fit her vision, openly acknowledging that the Africa of cities and modernization is not the true Africa to her. She got tired as her long trip went on, her notes and purchases slowly petering off as she worked her way up to Egypt. She was independent, going on this trip alone without her husband in the 1950s. She was creative and generous, wanting to share her experiences with the people back home who would never have the same opportunity. Lydia left us her Africa in her letters, notes, works of art, and receipts that she collected along the way. Flipping through her scrapbook is both fascinating and charming, permeated with 1950s graphic design and fascinating peeks into the logistics and costs of travel.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Yet she did not record the information that I have desperately wanted to know. Tasked with selecting objects to write about, I had to first determine where they may have been made and by who. I combed through thousands of pages of museum databases in search of comparatives that could give me a hint as to their origin. I looked in books and catalogues and online auction listings. I did my best to narrow it down, but often my identification must remain unproven. Tourist art of this ilk has not traditionally been valued by museums and, without going to Africa myself, I am left with the research I have been able to assemble, hopeful that it is helpful or interesting in some way to those who stumble upon this project. My sincere hope is that more expert eyes than my own can clarify the questions of origin and artist that I am unable to deduce.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Lydia did not record the makers of the objects she collected and perhaps was not interested in their facture; she seems to have bought several of her pieces from curio shops or other stores who did the sourcing for her. The interest for her like many other Western tourists was likely their perceived exoticism, their prototypical “Africanness.” Much as I yearn to know the artists behind the many beautiful objects she assembled, I have been forced to come to terms with the fact that I will likely never know. And so I asked myself, how do I value African makers without only seeing them through Lydia’s eyes? This is what led to our exploration of contemporary African artists whose work resonates with Lydia’s journey and the objects she collected. It is an imperfect solution but one that I hope brings balance to the fraught politics of White tourism that Lydia’s journey emblematizes here.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Throughout this process, I have learned an enormous amount. I have learned about mid-century African art, about the impact of tourism on local economies, about styles of South African beadwork, about the weight of camera equipment in the 50s, about innumerable extraordinary contemporary artists, and about the enriching process of collaboration. Discussions with Basia Kapolka, and Yian Wang were edifying, productive, and stimulating. As we worked through the thorny conceptualization of the project, the practicalities of executing our ideas, and the bumps that cropped up along the way, I was reminded of the importance of community to creation. The African artists who made many of the works we display here also likely worked in community, learning from their elders, exchanging ideas, and selling their wares alongside one another. It has been a privilege to be in community with Basia, Yian, and our many other collaborators and contributors and to see Africa from within but also beyond Lydia’s eyes.\"\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)\n  })) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{"title":"Lead Researcher and Writer","navigation":"Making"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/Making/[slug]","query":{"slug":"researcher_writer"},"buildId":"WttSZQl5fwMQvrurlLRp9","assetPrefix":"/AnAmericansAfrica","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
