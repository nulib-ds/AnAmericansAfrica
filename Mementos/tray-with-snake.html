The art of calabash carving and decoration as seen here is a prevalent form of expression in Nigeria.

Calabash in Hausa language, spoken in parts of northern Nigeria, is called “kwarya”.

A prominent carver among them was named Onírèsé, who was identified by an Ifa priest at birth as a great leader.

A classic example is the Tray with the design of snake. Snakes are revered in many parts of Africa; the python, for example,depicts the war god Ogidia among the people of Benin and Brass of the Niger Delta region. Similarly, snakes are significant in Yoruba tradition, symbolizing rebirth and renewal. This symbolism is deeply rooted in Yoruba mythology, where the snake is associated with Osumare, a rainbow serpent god. The god is the son of the goddess Yemọja and the God Ọ̀rúnmìlà. Because snakes shed their skin, the god is associated with rebirth or renewal.
